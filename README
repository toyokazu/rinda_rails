Rinda Rails
===========

    RindaRails plugin helps to write master-worker style programming with Rails
    environment using Rinda frameworks.


Example
=======

    The following command stubs out a new worker. Pass worker name,
    under_scored.

    `./script/generate rinda_worker analyzer`


Configuration
=============

    To use worker class defined in app/workers from your Rails default
    environment, you must append app/workers path to the load_paths of
    Rails. You should also append "daemons" gem to use Rinda::Client.

    edit config/environment.rb

    Rails::Initializer.run do |config|
    ...
      # add config.load_paths setting
      config.load_paths += %W( #{RAILS_ROOT}/app/workers )
      # add "daemons" to use Rinda::Client
      config.gem "daemons"
    ...
    end
